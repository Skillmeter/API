# Integration Scenario (WIP)

This section walks you though a generic integration scenario.
The process has been designed to be really simple and allow you to set it up quickly.  

## 1. Configure your Skillmeter account
### Personalize your company's test center page
This is the first step you need to take after you set up your account with Skillmeter.   Personalize your company's test center page with your logo and links to your website and social channels.

### Create tests
Then create/set-up one or more tests in the test section.  You have different options to parametrize your tests and you can add a wide variety of question types.

### Notifications template
If you want to let Skillmeter send email invites to  candidates each time they are assigned to a test, go to the Notifications section, customize the notification template and turn on the notifications sending.

## 2. Integrate with Skillmeter
